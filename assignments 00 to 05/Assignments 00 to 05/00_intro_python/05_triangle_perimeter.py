## Problem Statement 5

# Prompt the user to enter the lengths of each side of a triangle 
# and then calculate and print the perimeter of the triangle (the sum of all of the side lengths).

def main():
    # Get the 3 side lengths of the triangle
    side1: float = float(input("What is the length of side 1? "))
    side2: float = float(input("What is the length of side 2? "))
    side3: float = float(input("What is the length of side 3? "))

    # Print out the perimeter (sum of the sides) of the triangle, make sure to cast it to a str when concatenating!
    print("The perimeter of the triangle is " + str((side1 + side2 + side3)))
