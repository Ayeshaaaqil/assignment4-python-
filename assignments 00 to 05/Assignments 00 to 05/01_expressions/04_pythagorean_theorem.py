## Problem Statement 10
# Write a program that asks the user for the lengths of the two 
# perpendicular sides of a right triangle and outputs the length of the 
# third side (the hypotenuse) using the Pythagorean theorem!

# The Pythagorean theorem, named after the ancient Greek thinker, 
# Pythagoras, is a fundamental relation in geometry. It states that in a right triangle,
# the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the square of the other two sides.

# For instance, let's consider a right triangle ABC, with the right angle located at C. According to the Pythagorean theorem:
# BC ** 2 = AB ** 2 + AC ** 2

import math  # Import the math library so we can use the sqrt function

def main():
    # Get the two side lengths from the user and cast them to be numbers
    ab: float = float(input("Enter the length of AB: "))
    ac: float = float(input("Enter the length of AC: "))

    # Calculate the hypotenuse using the two sides and print it out
    bc: float = math.sqrt(ab**2 + ac**2) 
    print("The length of BC (the hypotenuse) is: " + str(bc))

# There is no need to edit code beyond this point
